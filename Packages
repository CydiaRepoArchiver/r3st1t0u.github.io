Description: The package automatically enables substrate when running mach_portal jailbreak. This is beta software. I will try to provide support, but expect some bugs. Should bugs arise, please alert me of the issue calmly so that I may fix it. I try to reply to everyone, but even if I don't, I read it all and consider the messages for future updates. Special thanks to @DillanCodez for his help on this. Follow me on twitter @r3st1t0u. If you'd like to buy me a coffee, use paypal.me/r3st1t0u to donate!

Description: This is a SpringBoard icon to execute order66 in order to better fix substrate on the iPhone 7/7+, and improve the stability of Yalub3. As of version 1.1 I've added a temporary icon, fixed layout issues on 7+ devices, and switched to a dark UI. This is still beta software, just an fyi. This version is also arm64 just because I can.
