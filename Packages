Description: Adds the command "execute" in terminal which enables substrate and launches LaunchDaemons that currently aren't launching automatically. This fixes tweaks such as Rocketbootstrap and Anemone. This is for iPhone 7 users on the mach_portal jailbreak. As of version 1.1, this should support other tweaks that usually would need a reinstall. It also no longer reinstalls packages through the script, and it enables them with the tweak’s LaunchDaemon. This version should enable compatibility with all tweaks that rely on /Library/LaunchDaemons/. This version also changes the command used from “fix” to “execute” because quite a few people requested for me not to use fix. issues with Yalub3

Version 1.2 fixes an error on my part causing this not to function every time. Version 1.3 changes how the SpringBoard is killed in order to increase stability and updates the change log to fix an error that was bothering me. In the future, I plan on creating a version of this that can be launched from an icon. Follow me on twitter at @r3st1t0u!
